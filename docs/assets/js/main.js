					<p>Put.Call.Bot is a software solution that evaluates quantitative analysis from real time Bovespa exchange market data, sending buy and sell signals to brokers according to the algorithmic strategy chosen by the trader.</p>
					<p>By providing investment robots that operate 100% automatically, Put.Call.Bot positions itself at the forefront of the financial revolution, offering solutions that transcend traditional methods. These automated systems are designed to analyze real-time data, identify market opportunities, and execute transactions swiftly, all without human intervention.</p>
                    <p>This approach not only increases the effectiveness of operations but also significantly reduces the potential for errors resulting from impulsive or emotional decisions. The trust placed in Put Call Bot's sophisticated algorithms reflects the company's dedication to providing its clients with a safer, transparent, and more effective investment experience.</p>
					<p>This automated trading system is a very powerful no-code web platform that allows our clients to work from any web browser or device. It is designed to negotiate stocks, options, derivatives and future instruments in a low or high frequency trading way and manages day trade or swing trade positions as well.</p>
                    <p>The trader can work with virtual orders or set to route them to his broker, also one or more broker accounts can be saved and used.</p>
                    <p>Our platform allows the trader to create, debug, test, optimize, and execute trading robots in an exclusive environment totally independent from the production server, and also a development server can be requested to safely build and test their algorithms.</p>
                    <p>When the work is done, all these strategies can be published to production in the real world environment. The main purpose of PutCallBot is to replace the hard work of following the market tick by tick giving time to the trader to evaluate better strategies for his portfolio.</p>
					<p>Following this is a document that I made explaining this project better.<br>

					</p>
					<p>In the early days of this project, I made our electronic integration to the <b>XP Broker Electronic Trade System (ETS)</b> and the <b>Brazilian Bovespa Exchange Order Management System (OMS)</b> using the <b>Financial Information eXchange protocol (FIX)</b> which is an electronic communications protocol for international real-time exchange of information related to securities transactions and markets. As I have a strict budget for this project, I researched and luckily found a great 100% free and open source solution with a great community support. So, I decided to use the <a href="https://quickfixn.org/">QuickFIX/n</a> library which implements the <b>FIX</b> protocol on <b>.NET</b>. Later I also integrated our system with other electronic trading system providers as <a href="https://www.cedrotech.com/">Cedro Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.metatrader5.com/">Metatrader</a> and <a href="https://www.nelogica.com.br/">Nelogica</a>, consuming their API's.</p>
					<p><i>I've also created an extensive document to help me guide my skeptical colleagues, who are Microsoft stack developers, to build the environment needed to deploy a <b>.NET (all) microservice to AWS Lambda Serverless Function</b>, using a Ubuntu/Linux distribution and the cost-effective <b>Graviton processor</b> based in the Arm64 architecture. Along this process, I realized that the installation and the related configuration using this architecture was a sort of problematic depending on the installation pathway chosen. So, I decided to describe the solutions that worked better for our development context and maybe could also help someone else outside our playground. My colleagues, who were once resistant, now are engaged and using this DevContainer development concept. To support some tasks presented in this guide, I've created some bash scripts running <b>.NET CLI</b> and <b>AWS CLI</b> commands.

					<p>AWS Lambda Function microservice to control IP requests and web resources using Geolocation by Country and City.</p>
					<p><img class="pcb-logo" src="assets/img/pcb/IPGeoGuard.jpg" alt="IPGeoGuard" /></p>
					<p>This project is a microservice that provides a Geolocation protection layer verifying an incoming request and using virtual geographic perimeters to determine if its IP address is allowed to access a restricted service resource. It is very useful when the ip address is available, but not the coordinate.</p>
					<p>Another great future is to be capable of showing audience locations to see where the biggest audience exists. It is possible to create reports grouping user traffic by country and city.</p>
					<p>These are the main targets of this project:
					<ul>
						<li>Block requests from restricted geographic areas</li>
						<li>Allow requests from permitted geographic areas</li>
						<li>Enable/disable features for specific regions</li>
						<li>Keep and report audience traffic by location (Country, City...)</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>This project is a .NET 8 microservice hosted in AWS Lambda Function and can be easily integrated consuming a file in GeoJSON format.</p>
					<p>The incoming request IP address is translated into a geographic location and verified in the whitelist or blacklist files configured by the system administrator.</p>
					<p>This IPGeoGuard microservice consumes the IP Geolocation API tool to determine a user's location and use the geolocation information.
					<a href="https://www.ip2location.io">IP2 Location API</a></p>
					<p>I created an AWS API Gateway to invoke the IP GeoGuard Lambda function using its REST API. Using AWS API Gateway provides a secure HTTP endpoint to invoke this Lambda function and it helps manage large volumes of calls by throttling traffic and automatically validating and authorizing API calls. So, it's good practice to implement this connectivity layer.</p>
					<p>In this project, for my experimental purposes, I am also using <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis Database, in-memory storage</a> to cache Geolocation metadata, so I can significantly reduce IP2Location API requests. Redis is the world's fastest in-memory database and extremely easy to integrate. For the sake of simplicity and seamless integration, I decided to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/">AWS MemoryDB</a>, Redis OSS-compatible service for ultra-fast performance, but being aware of related infrastructure costs, a trade-off analysis is strongly recommended.</p>
					<p>I recently submitted this project to the <a href="https://contest.ip2location.com/#ipinfodb-invitation">IP2Location.io Programming Contest</a>. I found it would be a perfect opportunity to test my abilities, learn new techniques and share my knowledge.</p>
					<p><img class="pcb-logo" src="assets/img/pcb/IP2LocationContest.jpg" alt="IP2Location Contest" /></p>
					<p>I also created a minimal Web API project with ASP.NET Core. I named it SimpleApi and it is used solely for demonstration. I designed these functions:
					<ul>
					<li>GetCurrentTime => first check if the requested IP address can access this service using the IPGeoGuard. If it is allowed, then print the server current time. Otherwise, returns the region restriction warning message.</li>
					<li>GetMapViews => print the stored requested IPs aggregated  by Country and City.</li>
					<li>PutRestriction => set Country restriction for GetCurrentTime function.</li>
					<li>DeleteRestriction => remove Country restriction for GetCurrentTime function.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><img class="pcb-logo" src="articles/CryptoCurrencyExchangeBroker/CryptoCurrencyExchangeBroker_1240.jpg" alt="CryptoCurrencyExchangeBroker_1240" /></p>
					<p>Recently at my current company, I implemented an agnostic cloud architecture solution using the DockerHub container repository to register some microservices images that could be published to our AWS or Azure cloud spaces. We are evaluating some AWS cost concerns.</p>
					<p>I have been using Azure cloud resources for my personal labs for about 3 years, and actually I really enjoy working with Azure solutions and even more because it can be easily integrated with Visual Studio and GitHub. They are also using amazing technologies such as Biceps for CI/CD deployment.</p>
					<p>So, inspired by this recent study, I decided to create on my Azure account a micro service project that should consume Azure resources, then I came up with this CryptoCurrency project to present to my fellows a simple way to learn a Websocket API server using .NET 8 and also Entity Framework consuming a NoSQL database, the Azure Cosmos DB, which is great for low latency performance.</p>
					<p>I developed this project based on Parallel Programming, SOLID, Clean Code, Object Oriented, Domain Driven Design and Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) concepts. The persistence layer has an important abstraction that could allow me change the database management system without changing the business logic layer. The Entity Framework also helps to achieve this level of abstraction modeling the storage entities for us.</p>
					<p>
					<img class="pcb-logo" src="articles/CryptoCurrencyExchangeBroker/CryptoCurrencyExchangeBrokerHighLevelDesign.jpg" alt="CryptoCurrencyExchangeBroker" /<br/>
					<div>Project Highlights:</div>
					<ul>
						<li>CryptoCurrency .NET 8 Minimal API solution using the Bitstamp.net crypto exchange Websocket API.</li>
						<li>Adopted GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to Azure Web App and also consuming Azure Cosmos DB with Entity Framework.</li>
						<li>Enable/disable features for specific regions</li>
						<li>Development based on Parallel Programming, SOLID, Separation of Concerns, Clean Code, Object Oriented and Domain Driven Design best practices.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>This project is a .NET 8 microservice hosted on my Azure account.</p>
					<p>This is the public API url:<br/>
					<a href="https://cryptocurrencyexchangebrokerapi20240930232221.azurewebsites.net/">https://cryptocurrencyexchangebrokerapi20240930232221.azurewebsites.net/</a><br/>
					<img class="pcb-logo" src="articles/CryptoCurrencyExchangeBroker/home-api.png" alt="HomeAPI" />
					</p>
					<p>As I am using my Azure account, I have to be very cautious about related cloud costs. So, I am using the FREE F1 plan that unfortunately takes a minute to warm up the service and also it has these constrains:<br/>
						<ul>
							<li>Limited compute and memory resources: The F1 plan provides a shared instance of a single CPU core and 1 GB of memory.</li>
							<li>Limited traffic: The F1 plan allows only up to 1 hour of CPU usage in a day.</li>
							<li>Limited features: The F1 plan does not include some features as auto-scaling.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>I've created a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to Azure Web App and I also configured it to be public. So, it's possible to consume this API using <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> or <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">SWAGGER UI</a>.<br/>
						<img class="pcb-logo" src="articles/CryptoCurrencyExchangeBroker/SWAGGER_API.png" alt="SWAGGER_API" />
					</p>
					<p>I implemented an API function to create a very simple HTML to show the Crypto Coin Order Book. I simply put a head meta data tag to refresh the page each 5 seconds.<br/>

A Digital System for Measurements in Gypsum Molds for Orthodontics Mechanical Engineering Department
<a class="toggle-link" data-hidden="click here to see more info" data-shown="show less"></a>
<div class="toggle-panel">
<p>I was very lucky to be in the right place at the right time when I was invited to collaborate on this project.</p>
<p>At that time I was working as a C++ programmer at the Robotics Lab of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ on a public funded research project.
This Lab coordinator asked me if I could offer some kind of help for his research team to solve a puzzle they were facing on another project which was a cooperation with the Orthodontics department from the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, UFMS.<br>
A PHD doctor was doing research to propose a new technique to correct maxillae malformation, executing on the patient's jaws a series of surgeries based on the results from his study. In order to support him, we conceived a system to automate processes such as data acquisition, data manipulation, image visualization and evaluation of results from data analysis.</p>
I developed a dedicated Windows program coded in Borland C++ 6.0 which was responsible for capturing the joint variables acquisition and conversion into Cartesian coordinates, through direct kinematics relations. 
Then, the image of the mold contour was shown in the computer screen so that the user can visualize the results of the data acquisition being analyzed and decide whether they are ready or not to be registered in the database file. Statistics was extensively used to evaluate data from acquired curves. 
In 2003 this digital system for measuring gypsum molds was used by Dr. Marcelo Arruda and he evaluated more than 3000 models in three days at Dr. Andrew J. Haas Laboratory, in Chicago, USA.
The on site and offline tasks were performed with success.</p>
<p>The goodwill of this project was noteworthy and with the positive impact in so many patients' lives, we were awarded and recognized by the Mechanical Science and Engineering Brazilian Association (ABCM).</p>

<p>I am a seasoned Principal Systems Engineer & Backend Developer with more than 25 years in software development and team management in Banking, Startup, Fintech and also collaborating across the globe in large companies as Microsoft.${vids}</p>
<p class="currentmemo">&ldquo;I'm currently working at Microsoft Silicon, Cloud Hardware, and Infrastructure Engineering (SCHIE) as Tech Lead Product and Site Reliability Engineering - SRE, Level 1, building reliable and scalable systems to infrastructure, emphasizing automation (CI/CD), observability, and incident management, debugging production issues, and post-incident reviews. I'm also responsible for guiding and mentoring junior colleagues. I wrote technical documents and also a Zero to Hero guide to help onboard new team members too.
My team is based in the Microsoft headquarters campus at Redmond, WA, USA, but I also support and have meetings with teams located in the Microsoft India Development Center (IDC), from Hyderabad and Noida cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I've been developing and contributing for the Juno orchestrator project, and also for the internal and public GitHub repo of the Virtual Client platform, developing solutions for monitoring, benchmarking and running customer-representative scenarios on virtual machines or physical hosts. I'm developing these solutions using GitHub, VisualStudio, VS Code, C#, .NET 10, Python, PowerShell and Bash scripts.
I'm using Azure Data Explorer (ADX) to collect and analyze log ingestion and real-time telemetries from their petabytes data lake. I've been developing queries using Kusto Query Language (KQL).</p>
<p>I have the capability and versatility of solving complex and unknown problems. I like to go beyond borders to bring and share knowledge with our team members and stakeholders. From my vast experience dealing with a large range of challenges of different businesses and sizes, including Startup. Fintech and large companies as Microsoft, <b>I am able to start collaborating and delivering results from day one</b>.</p>
<p>I'm very proud to be a valuable member of the Microsoft Cloud Infrastructure team. It's worthwhile to mention I succeeded at all Microsoft challenging hiring interview rounds, meaning I'm vetted to deploy reliable and scalable systems by applying software engineering solutions.</p>
<p class="currentmemo">&ldquo;Before Microsoft, for more than 10 years, I had been working asynchronously as a Staff Engineer in a full remote position at <a href="https://putcallbot.com/">PutCallBot</a>, a Fintech company that develops stock market trading solutions, including a stock portfolio management system that autonomously makes smart and fast trade decisions, using Quant trading strategies. My last project was a brownfield project, being responsible to modernize our .NET Framework ecosystem from a monolithic architecture based in Virtual Machines running Windows Servers to a Service Oriented Architecture, using AWS Lambda Serverless Function, DynamoDB, AWS RDS for SQL Server, AWS S3 Bucket, AWS Event Bridge, .NET 8, Entity Framework, Docker images and applying the .NET Microservices Architecture.<img class="AWSLambdaFunction" src="assets/img/AWSLambdaFunction.jpg"> I am coding on a VS Code Dev Container running a Docker in Docker approach on a Ubuntu/Linux EC2 Instance and using GitHub for version control. Before getting this project approval, I developed a .NET Core Web App consuming  resources of my personal Azure account in order to build a prototype and create a viability study for this modernization. I've crafted an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yg7iscwM2IChCxy66aYhOB4-kA_9cgu6XC3Ar5RNn5k/edit?usp=sharing">all-in-one guide (click to open)</a> to help me train my colleagues to publish .NET 8 microservices to AWS Lambda Function, using really cool stuff and also reducing our costs !&rdquo;</p>
<p>I graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ, one of the most prestigious universities in Brazil, and worked in their Robotics Lab until graduation. I post-graduated in Computer Science & System Project Management from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro - PUC-RIO also a renowned university in Brazil.</p>
<p>I am a researcher by nature and I am very proud to say that one of my research projects was awarded and recognized with the ABCM-EMBRAER Aerospace 2004 prize.</p>
<p>I am working at Microsoft as a vendor from Wipro Company, with the Tech Lead Band B3, Developer L4 role. I can deliver to our customers technical design and development solutions, managing teams, mentoring engineers, and acting as a Subject Matter Expert (SME).</p>
<p>My former CEO usually said that I am a T-shaped person collaborating and nurturing multiple areas of connections. As I am a developer with a mechanical engineering, academic research and financial background, I can easily cross beyond borders building strong bridges with network, security, compliance, sales and business teams.</p>

<div class="toggle-panel">
<p>It's worthwhile to mention that I built the Quant trading system that became the Fintech I worked for. Impacting real demanding users who are wealthy and high-profile banking customers, this Fintech project is a dream come true for people that love software engineering and problem-solving routine because of its technical challenges we face everyday. It is a real world sandbox in production, where I do a lot of research, learn and experiment new techie acknowledgments in countless use case scenarios, that can be applied beyond borders in many IT projects of companies around the world. So, I am sure I can bring value and a humble collaboration to my future partners, sharing thoughts and having an active listening approach to my colleagues opinions, growing a deeper connection based in empathy, respect and friendliness.</p>
<p>All the business logic implementations I try to apply some design patterns concepts detailed in the Gang of Four book, also I like to get inspired by some SOLID ideas and Domain-Driven Design to help non-coders to understand what I've meant to deliver. Before coding, I collect all kinds of requirements or specifications to clearly describe and tell a good user story, a task or use case scenario. This procedure helps me continue improving the concept and also deliver small pieces to a business partner follows its evaluation.</p>
<p>Besides the business logic in the backend side written in C#, for the frontend I also created an extensive JavaScript framework library to help build dynamic and responsive web interfaces, including dialog windows, forms, dynamic and smart spreadsheets, reports, interactive charts, and client-server communication consuming our REST API services.</p>
<p>At that time, I started a personal project to use some Deep Learning techniques using the ML.NET Framework with the purpose of getting better results in our prediction models. For this project I started to use some libraries and models using Python, Pandas, Jupyter, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow coding in VSCode and Google Colab.</p>
<p>I'm currently looking for the opportunity to work remotely in IT projects abroad.</p>
<p>My hour is a commodity that your budget can take advantage of.
As I work from the seashore of the wonderful City of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we can together be very happy with the currency exchange rates. So, it's definitely a win–win game for us!</p>
<p>Available to start work right now on a full or part-time remote job,
<br/><u>also flexible for any time zone overlap</u>.</p>
